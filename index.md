**Bio**

Hey there! 👋 So glad you stopped by!

I'm Eugene Grebennikov, and I'm thrilled to be working as a Principal Software Engineer at NBCUniversal. 🚀 My passion? Making sure our content reaches our amazing audience of over 130 million monthly users with ease. I get to play with cool tech, making big decisions on how we build our systems to keep everything running smoothly and quickly. ⚡️

Oh, and guess what? I've recently had the joy of mentoring an Advanced Go course for software developers at Yandex Practicum. It's been such a blast sharing my love for coding! When I'm not geeking out over software, you'll catch me jamming on my guitar 🎸 or getting my heart rate up with various sports. 🏋️‍♂️ Life's all about balance, right?**Contacts**
